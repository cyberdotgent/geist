# Agent Log

## 2026-06-14

- Updated `AGENTS.md` with repository workflow guidance for `Format/`,
  `AnalysisNotes/`, the attached IDA Pro MCP instance, the running BookServer
  reader URL, the Java/JNI reader as a secondary source, and the requirement to
  commit and push after each workload.
- Created this `AGENTLOG.md` to record agent activity going forward.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with `libgeist/` guidance: self-contained BOO parser
  library scope, `src/` versus `examples/` roles, planned example tools
  (`booinfo`, `bootoc`, `boorsrc`, `boorender`), and exact-as-stored media
  extraction behavior.
- Stubbed `libgeist/` so it compiles: added a CMake project, a self-contained
  `geist` static library, public BOO document API, and initial `booinfo`,
  `bootoc`, `boorsrc`, and `boorender` examples. Verified with
  `cmake -S libgeist -B C:\tmp\geist-libgeist-build`,
  `cmake --build C:\tmp\geist-libgeist-build`, and smoke runs against
  `BOO\QS3X36CM.BOO`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to require the installed MSVC toolchain for Windows CMake
  configure/build validation, avoiding GCC/MinGW-style toolchains unless
  explicitly requested for comparison.
